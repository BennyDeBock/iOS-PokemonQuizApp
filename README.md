# iOS-PokemonQuizApp
Assignment to make a responsive iOS app. App has to connect with an external API. 

## The Project
The idea of the project is to make a pokemon quiz api where people will be able to choose the region they want to quiz the pokemon off. The game will show a silhouette of the pokemon in question (that was fetched from the api) and the player will have to guess the pokemon in question. On a right answer they get to choose wether they want to continue with the quiz or quit. A highscore will be kept of all right guesses per region.  
  
The API in question for this project is [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co)
